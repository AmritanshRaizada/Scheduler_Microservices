# ðŸ“ˆ Scaling Strategy & API Management (One-Pager)

To handle increased load and distributed services (up to 10,000 users and 6,000+ API requests/minute), the Job Scheduler microservice can be scaled using the following strategies:

## âœ… 1. Horizontal Scaling with Containers

*   Dockerize the microservice and deploy multiple instances across regions using orchestration tools like **Kubernetes** or **Docker Swarm**.
*   Use auto-scaling based on CPU/memory usage or request thresholds.
*   Place these instances behind a load balancer (e.g., **Nginx**, **AWS ALB**, or **Kubernetes Ingress**).

## âœ… 2. API Gateway for Centralized API Management

*   Use tools like **Kong**, **AWS API Gateway**, or **NGINX** to:
    *   Throttle traffic
    *   Route requests to microservice instances
    *   Handle authentication, caching, and logging
*   These act as a single entry point, making distributed services easier to manage.

## âœ… 3. Message Queue for Job Dispatching

*   Offload job execution from HTTP requests using asynchronous processing via:
    *   **RabbitMQ**, **Apache Kafka**, or **AWS SQS**
*   The API just stores jobs in the database and pushes them to a queue; dedicated worker services consume and execute them reliably.

## âœ… 4. Database Optimization

*   Use indexes on `job name`, `nextRun`, and `createdAt` for faster queries.
*   Implement read replicas in **MongoDB Atlas** for global distribution and to offload read-heavy queries.
*   Use caching for `GET` endpoints via **Redis** or an in-memory store to reduce database load.

## âœ… 5. Rate Limiting & Throttling

*   Implement rate limiting within the service using middleware like `express-rate-limit` to prevent abuse.
*   An **API Gateway** or **Reverse Proxy** can apply further rate controls at the edge, before requests hit the service.

## âœ… 6. Monitoring & Observability

*   Integrate with tools like:
    *   **Prometheus + Grafana** for metrics and dashboards.
    *   **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.
    *   **Sentry**, **New Relic**, or **Datadog** for application performance monitoring and error tracking.
*   This helps monitor job failures, latency, and overall service health in real-time.

## âœ… 7. Service Discovery & Communication

*   If deployed as part of a larger microservices ecosystem:
    *   Use service discovery tools like **Consul** or **Eureka** to allow services to find each other dynamically.
    *   Orchestrate internal service-to-service communication via efficient protocols like **gRPC** or standard **REST**.
